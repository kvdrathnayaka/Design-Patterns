// If the processor is not able to process anything, it just forwards the same request to the next chain.

// This is a very important step, and we should create the chain carefully, otherwise a processor might not be getting any request at all.
// For example, in our implementation if we keep the first processor chain as LKR10Dispenser and then LKR20Dispenser,
// then the request will never be forwarded to the second processor and the chain will become useless.
